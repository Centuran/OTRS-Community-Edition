=head1 NAME

Devel::TypeTiny::Perl56Compat - shims to allow Type::Tiny to run on Perl 5.6.x

=head1 STATUS

This module is considered part of Type-Tiny's internals. It is not
covered by the
L<Type-Tiny stability policy|Type::Tiny::Manual::Policies/"STABILITY">.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is not considered part of Type::Tiny's public API.

Currently this module just has one job: it patches L<B> to export a
C<perlstring> function, as this was only added in Perl 5.8.0.
