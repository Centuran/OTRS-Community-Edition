=head1 NAME

Date::ICal - Perl extension for ICalendar date objects.

=head1 VERSION

$Revision: 678 $

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Date::ICal;

    $ical = Date::ICal->new( ical => '19971024T120000' );
    $ical = Date::ICal->new( epoch => time );
    $ical = Date::ICal->new( year => 1964,
        month => 10, day => 16, hour => 16,
        min => 12, sec => 47 );

    $hour = $ical->hour;
    $year = $ical->year;

    $ical_string = $ical->ical;
    $epoch_time = $ical->epoch;

    $ical2 = $ical + $duration;

(Where $duration is either a duration string, like 'P2W3DT7H9M', or a
Date::ICal::Duration (qv) object.

    $ical += 'P6DT12H';

    $duration = $ical - $ical2;
    $ical3 = $ical - $duration;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Date::ICal talks the ICal date format, and is intended to be a base class for
other date/calendar modules that know about ICal time format also.

=head1 AUTHOR

Rich Bowen, and the Reefknot team. Alas, Reefknot is no more. See
http://datetime.perl.org/ for more modern and accurate modules.

=head1 METHODS

Date::ICal has the following methods available:

=head2 new

A new Date::ICal object can be created with any valid ICal string:

    my $ical = Date::ICal->new( ical => '19971024T120000' );
    # will default to the timezone specified in $TZ, see below

Or with any epoch time:

    my $ical = Date::ICal->new( epoch => time );

Or, better still, create it with components

    my $date = Date::ICal->new( 
                           day => 25, 
                           month => 10, 
                           year => 1066,
                           hour => 7,
                           min => 15,
                           sec => 47
                           );

If you call new without any arguments, you'll get a Date::ICal object that is
set to the time right now.

    my $ical = Date::ICal->new();

If you already have an object in Date::ICal, or some other subclass
thereof, you can create a new Date::ICal (or subclass) object using
that object to start with. This is particularly useful for converting
from one calendar to another:

   # Direct conversion from Discordian to ISO dates
   my $disco = Date::Discordian->new( disco => '12 Chaos, YOLD 3177' );
   my $iso = Date::ISO->new( $disco );
   print $iso->iso;

new() handles timezones. It defaults times to UTC (Greenwich
Mean Time, also called Zulu). If you want to set up a time
that's in the US "Pacific" timezone, which is GMT-8, use something
like:
    
    my $ical = Date::ICal->new( ical => '19971024T120000',
                                offset => "-0800");
   
Note that as of version 1.44, new() tries to be intelligent
about figuring out your local time zone. If you enter
a time that's not *explicitly* in UTC, it looks at
the environment variable $TZ, if it exists, to determine
your local offset. If $TZ isn't set, new() will complain.

representable as such. (Dates before 1971 or after 2038 will not have an epoch
representation.)

Internals note: The ICal representation of the date is considered the only
authoritative one. This means that we may need to reconstruct the epoch time
from the ICal representation if we are not sure that they are in synch. We'll
need to do clever things to keep track of when the two may not be in synch.
And, of course, the same will go for any subclasses of this class.

Sets or retrieves the offset from UTC for this time. This allows
timezone support, assuming you know what your local (or non-local)
UTC offset is. Defaults to 0. 

Internals note: all times are internally stored in UTC, even though they
may have some offset information. Offsets are internally stored in
signed integer seconds. 

BE CAREFUL about using this function on objects that were initialized
with an offset. If you started an object with:
    
    my $d = new(ical=>'19700101120000', offset=>'+0100'); 

and you then call: 

    $d->offset('+0200'); 
    
you'll be saying "Yeah, I know I *said* it was in +0100, but really I
want it to be in +0200 now and forever." Which may be your intention,
if you're trying to transpose a whole set of dates to another timezone---
but you can also do that at the presentation level, with
the ical() method. Either way will work.

    $date->add( duration => 'P1WT1H1M1S' ); # add 1 wk, 1 hr, 1 min, and 1 sec

Adds a duration to a Date::ICal object.

Supported paraters are: duration, eom_mode, year, month, week, day,
hour, min, sec or seconds.

'duration' is a ICalendar duration string (see duration_value).

If a value is undefined or omitted, 1 is assumed:

    $ical->add( 'minute' ); # add a minute

The result will be normalized. That is, the output time will have
meaningful values, rather than being 48:73 pm on the 34th of 
hexadecember.

Adding months or years can be done via three different methods,
specified by the eom_mode parameter, which then applies to all
additions (or subtractions) of months or years following it in the
parameter list.

The default, eom_mode => 'wrap', means adding months or years that
result in days beyond the end of the new month will roll over into the
following month.  For instance, adding one year to Feb 29 will result
in Mar 1.

If you specify eom_mode => 'limit', the end of the month is never
crossed.  Thus, adding one year to Feb 29, 2000 will result in Feb 28,
2001.  However, adding three more years will result in Feb 28, 2004,
not Feb 29.

If you specify eom_mode => 'preserve', the same calculation is done as
for 'limit' except that if the original date is at the end of the
month the new date will also be.  For instance, adding one month to
Feb 29, 2000 will result in Mar 31, 2000.

All additions are performed in the order specified.  For instance,
with the default setting of eom_mode => 'wrap', adding one day and one
month to Feb 29 will result in Apr 1, while adding one month and one
day will result in Mar 30.

a Date::ICal::Duration object.
